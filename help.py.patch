-    Provide both the name and the version of the Python implementation
-    currently running. For example, on CPython 2.7.5 it will return
-    {'name': 'CPython', 'version': '2.7.5'}.

+    ----------
 
-    This function works best on CPython and PyPy: in particular, it probably
-    doesn't work for Jython or IronPython. Future investigation should be done
-    to work out the correct shape of the code for those platforms.
